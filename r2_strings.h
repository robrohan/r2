    Built in the style of: https://github.com/nothings/stb

    This is written with game development in mind.

    Do this:
       #define R2_STRINGS_IMPLEMENTATION
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file 
    to create the implementation.

    // i.e. it should look like this:
    #include ...
    #include ...
    #include ...
    #define R2_STRINGS_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "r2_strings.h"

    You can then include without the define to just use the types
